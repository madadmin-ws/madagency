# 2. Importing The Data

Once you download the data in a CSV or Excel format, you can import it into Google Sheets.

**Step 5**: From Excel to Google Sheets.

If you have scheduled the report to be emailed regularly, whether daily, weekly, or monthly, you can automate some of the steps above.

Solutions like Zapier allow you to set up auto-imports of the data from the email attachment directly into Google Sheets.\
\
Since this can be different from setup to setup, we wonâ€™t cover that process in this guide. However, a quick Google search should help.

After you import the data, connect the sheet to Data Studio as a data source.\


**Step 6**: Add the data.

You will only need to connect the Google Sheet to the Data Studio Dashboard once.

Once connected, any changes to the data in the sheet will be reflected in the dashboard.\
Treat metrics such as reach and frequency and calculated metrics such as CPC, CPM, etc., carefully when combining and aggregating the data.

More on that in a few minutes. In the meantime, we can start designing and building our dashboard.
