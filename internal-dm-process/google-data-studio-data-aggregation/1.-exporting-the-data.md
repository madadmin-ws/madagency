# 1. Exporting The Data

The easiest way to get this underway is to create a downloadable report in Facebook Ads.

Be aware that if you want to measure the success of your ads by platform (i.e., Facebook, Instagram, etc.) and/or placement (Instagram Stories, Feed, Right Hand Column, etc.) you will not be able to see metrics such as Purchases, Purchases Conversion Value, or Cost per purchase.

That level of data is not available on the (Facebook Ads) platform, so it is also not accessible through the data no matter how you pull it, whether via the API, a connector, or manually downloaded as in our case.

Conversion data is only available at the top level.

If you want to see how your ads perform and measure their ROI (return on investment) or ROAS (return on ad spend), you will need to download the data broken down by Campaign, Ad Set, and/or time – only.\
\
You can still create and download an additional report that breaks the data down by delivery and, therefore, Platform and Placement.

However, that will only show you performance metrics such as Impressions, Reach, Clicks, CPC (cost-per-click), CPM (cost-per-thousand impressions), etc.

There is still a great case for using this data to evaluate and understand the performance of our ads across each platform and placement, and to use those lessons to optimize the campaign delivery.\


**Step 1**: Head to _Ads reporting_ and create a new report.

**Step 2**: Choose the metrics and dimensions for your report.

Here, it’s important that you have the final outcome in mind and what data you will require for the dashboard.\


**Step 3**: Schedule the report.

This is optional, but getting the reports sent to your inbox instead of downloading them every single time will make your life much easier!\

**Step 4**: You might need to manipulate the data.

Aligning the data downloaded from Facebook Ads might require some small changes.

In our example above, we changed the date column to ensure that Google Data Studio would recognize it.
