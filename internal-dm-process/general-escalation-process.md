# General Escalation Process

**Who:** Mad Digitals, Web, and Creatives\
**What:** An escalation process simplifies the channels and boundaries of decision-making within an organization for solving the problem quickly and effectively.\
**When:** Escalating clients/brands\
**Why:** To properly address escalation per level\
\
**How:**\
\
**Escalation flow:**\
Associate -> <mark style="color:purple;">Leads</mark> -> <mark style="color:green;">Heads of Division</mark> -> <mark style="color:orange;">Head of Operations</mark> -> <mark style="color:red;">General Manager</mark>\
\
**De-escalation flow:**\
**-** It is necessary for each and every role to follow the steps below prior to escalating the issue to the next level. \
\- It is a must to add complete notes in Plutio (conversation) about how we deescalate the situation prior to escalation.\
\
**Step 1:** Identify the "problem" \
\
**Step 2:** Find whatâ€™s causing the problem and analyze what potential impact it can cause on the project (For example, delays, inaccuracy, revision, or cost overruns).\
\
**Step 3:** Present alternative options for the resolution of the problem are elaborated along with their benefits and drawbacks. \
\
**Step 4:** The situation is presented to the client/brand body with a recommendation.\
This can be thru email, f2f or online meetings.\
\
**Step 5:** It is explained to the client/brand about what may happen if no decision is taken today (For example, delays or cost overruns).\
\
**Step 6:** The results of the de-escalation are documented per steps on Plutio (Project level -> Conversation).\
\- Conversation OPEN if NOT RESOLVED\
\- Conversation CLOSED if the issue is RESOLVED\

_- <mark style="color:red;">If a certain client/brand escalates, the general escalation process should be implemented immediately</mark>_\
_<mark style="color:red;">- If the escalation is business impacting, (change of account manager, overspending, client cancellation) immediate endorsement of the escalation to the division heads is necessary</mark>_\
_- <mark style="color:red;">Escalation to the next level will only be valid only if the de-escalation flow is done by the previous role.</mark>_
