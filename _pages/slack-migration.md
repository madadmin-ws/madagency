We will be enforcing a Slack migration for the Digital, Web, TikTok, and Creative departments. This will be carried out in four phases. Full migration is expected to be completed by June 30, 2024 where in Plutio integration of slack is also expected to be completed.

**Phase 1:** Internal Brand Communication Migration\
**Why:** Migration of all internal brand and stakeholder communication from Viber\
**Who:** Digitals, Creative Leads and Web Accounts\
\
**How:**\
Account Managers will create an internal chatroom for each brand. This involves creating chat groups for each sub-department, such as Digital, Web, TikTok, and Creative, if the existing service is applicable. If the brand is pure creative or web service, the creative leads or project managers will create the communication channel.

1\. Account Managers / Project Manager will create section on Slack \
2\. Inside section, create a private channel with the right naming convention BRAND\_INTERNAL\_(SubDepartment).\
3\. Create commercial and finance private channel BRAND\_INTERNAL\_COMMERCIAL\
4\. Add relevant people per department that is involved in the project on the private channel\
5\. Include: Patrick Clemencia, Jace Susara, Edward Baterzal\
