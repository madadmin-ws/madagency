* Based on this discussion, the team will create a content strategy outlining the key themes, messaging, and goals of the social media campaign.

**2 Content Plan Presentation**

* The Project Manager will collate the content strategy and create a comprehensive deck that outlines the content plan for the social media campaign.
* This deck will include details such as content types (e.g., text, images, videos), proposed posting schedule, and any other relevant information.
* The Project Manager will then present this content plan to the client for their review and approval.\

**4 Content Calendar Creation**

* After receiving the brand's approval of the content plan, the Project Manager will create a content calendar.
