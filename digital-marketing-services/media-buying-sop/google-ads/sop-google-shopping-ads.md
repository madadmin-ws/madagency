# âŒ› SOP - Google Shopping Ads

**A step-by-step guide on how to set up Google Shopping Ads:**

1. Create a Google Ads account: If you don't already have a Google Ads account, create one at ads.google.com. You'll need to provide basic information about your business, such as your website URL and contact information.
2. Create a Google Merchant Center account: A Google Merchant Center account is necessary to upload your product feed and manage your product listings. If you haven't already, create an account at merchants.google.com. You can also get the UTM link from Lazada or Shopee.
3. Set up your product feed: A product feed is a file that contains information about your products, such as the product name, description, image, price, and availability. You can create your feed manually or use a third-party tool to generate it. Upload your product feed to your Google Merchant Center account.
4. Verify and claim your website URL: To verify and claim your website URL, follow the instructions provided in the Merchant Center.
5. Create a Shopping campaign: In your Google Ads account, click on the "Campaigns" tab and select "New Campaign". Choose "Shopping" as your campaign type, select the country of sale, and choose your bidding strategy.
6. Set up your ad groups: Ad groups help you organize your products and set specific bids for each group. Divide your products into relevant categories and create ad groups accordingly. You can set bids at the ad group level.
7. Create your ads: Google will automatically create your ads based on the information in your product feed. However, you can customize your ads by adding promotional text or tweaking your image.
8. Set up conversion tracking: To track the performance of your campaigns, set up conversion tracking. You can use Google Ads conversion tracking or import conversions from Google Analytics.
9. Review and launch your campaign: Before launching your campaign, review your settings, bids, and budget. Once you're satisfied, launch your campaign.
