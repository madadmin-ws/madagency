# 2. Best Practices For Smart Shopping Campaign Setup

**SSC Prerequisites**\
\
**1. Conversion Values**\
The Google Ads account must have a conversion / imported GA event which is capturing transaction values. SA360 FL is fine to use here. Highly recommended that this is the only conversion factoring into Smart Bidding in the account.\
\
**2. Audiences**\
At least a single list with 100 active Display users. The best practice here is to house at least 10 audience lists including All Site Visitors and Purchase Funnel.\
\
**3. Healthy GMC Account**\
The client must have e-commerce available on landing page. Vertical such as Travel tickets, events, finance and auto are not supported on Google Shopping\*\
\
**Set-Up: A Step-by-Step Guide**\
Prior to launching any tests for an SSC, it’s important to set the guiding principles. Ensure that you are familiar with exactly what the client wants to get out of Shopping, and that they are comfortable with how it will achieve this.\

**Review Guiding Principles**\
Sometimes, a strategy that very narrowly maps to business objectives can actually undermine\
the Smart Shopping campaign algorithm’s ability to optimize by feeding in an insufficient amount of data

**Examples of Successful Strategies**\
In both examples below, the strategies map back to business goals while still following machine learning best practices.

**Design your Winning Strategy**\
Not sure where to start? Try the Product Group report in Google Ads. To access this report, open Google Ads, then go to Reports > Predefined Reports > Shopping > Product Type. This report makes it easy to see if certain types of product have generated better returns than others historically, as seen in the “Conv. Value/cost” column.\
