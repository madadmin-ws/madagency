# âŒ› SOP - Google Search Ads (Keyword Research)

**A step-by-step guide on how to do keyword research for Google Search Ads:**

1. Define your target audience: Start by defining your target audience, including their interests, needs, and search behavior. This will help you create a list of keywords that are relevant to your audience.
2. Use keyword research tools: Use keyword research tools such as Google Keyword Planner, SEMrush, or Ahrefs to generate a list of relevant keywords. These tools can provide data on search volume, competition, and related keywords that can help you find the best keywords for your ad campaign.
3. Analyze competitor ads: Analyze the ads of your competitors to identify the keywords they are targeting. This can help you identify gaps in their targeting and find new keywords to target.
4. Consider long-tail keywords: Long-tail keywords are longer, more specific phrases that are less competitive and often have a higher conversion rate. Consider including long-tail keywords in your ad campaign to attract more qualified leads.
5. Refine your keyword list: Refine your keyword list based on search volume, competition, relevance, and commercial intent. Use negative keywords to exclude irrelevant searches and focus on the most profitable keywords.
6. Group keywords into ad groups: Group your keywords into ad groups based on their relevance and commercial intent. This will help you create targeted ad campaigns that are tailored to specific keywords and audiences.
7. Continuously monitor and optimize: Continuously monitor the performance of your ad campaign and adjust your keywords and ad groups based on performance data. Use A/B testing to test different ad variations and optimize your campaign over time.

By following these steps, you can create a comprehensive keyword list for your Google Search Ads campaign that is tailored to your target audience and business goals.
